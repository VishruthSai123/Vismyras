# 🎉 Rate Limiting Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Rate limiting with user-friendly toast notifications has been successfully added to prevent API abuse.

---

## 📦 What Was Added

### New Components & Utilities

1. **`components/Toast.tsx`** - Beautiful toast notification system
   - 4 types: success, error, warning, info
   - Auto-dismiss with configurable duration
   - Smooth animations
   - Manual dismiss button

2. **`lib/rateLimiter.ts`** - Rate limiting utility
   - Per-minute limit: 10 requests
   - Per-hour limit: 100 requests  
   - Per-day limit: 1000 requests
   - LocalStorage persistence
   - Helpful error messages with retry times

3. **New Icons** - Added to `components/icons.tsx`
   - `XCircleIcon` (error)
   - `AlertTriangleIcon` (warning)
   - `InfoIcon` (info)

---

## 🔧 Modified Files

- ✅ `services/geminiService.ts` - Rate limit checks before all API calls
- ✅ `App.tsx` - Toast state management and notifications
- ✅ `components/StartScreen.tsx` - Toast integration for model generation

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Rate Limiting
- Before each API call, `checkAllLimits()` validates against all limits
- If limit exceeded, throws `RateLimitError` with friendly message
- Otherwise, consumes 1 request from each counter
- Automatically cleans up old timestamps

### Toast Notifications
- All operations show success toasts (green)
- All errors show error toasts (red)
- Rate limits show warning toasts (yellow)
- Tips show info toasts (blue)
- Position: Top-right corner
- Auto-dismiss after 2-7 seconds (configurable)

## 🚀 Try It Out!

The dev server is running at: http://localhost:3000/

### Test the Features:

1. **Upload a photo** → See success toast
2. **Try on multiple garments quickly** → See rate limit warning after 10 requests
3. **Change poses** → See success toasts
4. **Save outfits** → See success toasts
5. **Refresh page** → See "Welcome back" info toast

## 📊 Rate Limits (Per User)

| Limit | Requests | Window | API Free Tier |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Per Minute | 10 | 60 seconds | 15 (we're conservative) |
| Per Hour | 100 | 60 minutes | No official limit |
| Per Day | 1000 | 24 hours | 1500 (we're conservative) |

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Architecture
```
User Action
    ↓
geminiService checks rate limits (checkAllLimits())
    ↓
If limit exceeded → Throw RateLimitError → Show warning toast
    ↓
If limit OK → Consume request → Make API call
    ↓
On success → Show success toast
On error → Show error toast
```

### Data Flow
```
RateLimiter Class
    ↓
LocalStorage (persistent)
    ↓
{
  timestamps: [timestamp1, timestamp2, ...],
  lastReset: timestamp
}
    ↓
Auto-cleanup old timestamps
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjust Rate Limits
Edit `lib/rateLimiter.ts`:
```typescript
perMinute: new RateLimiter({
  maxRequests: 15,  // Change this
  windowMs: 60 * 1000,
  storageKey: 'vismyras_rate_limit_minute'
})
```

### Adjust Toast Duration
In any component:
```typescript
addToast('Message', 'success', 5000);  // 5 seconds
```

### Customize Toast Appearance
Edit `components/Toast.tsx` backgrounds and animations

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Rate Limit Status
Open browser console:
```javascript
// View minute stats
localStorage.getItem('vismyras_rate_limit_minute')

// Reset limits for testing
localStorage.removeItem('vismyras_rate_limit_minute')
localStorage.removeItem('vismyras_rate_limit_hour')
localStorage.removeItem('vismyras_rate_limit_day')
```

### Common Issues
- **Toasts not showing**: Check console for errors, verify ToastContainer is rendered
- **Rate limit too strict**: Adjust limits in rateLimiter.ts
- **Limits not persisting**: Check LocalStorage permissions

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Add rate limit status indicator in UI header
- [ ] Show "X requests remaining" badge

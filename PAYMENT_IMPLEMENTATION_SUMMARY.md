## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### Free User Journey
```
1. User signs up → Gets 3 free try-ons
2. Uses all 3 try-ons
3. Attempts 4th try-on → Paywall appears
4. Options shown:
   - Subscribe to Premium (₹199/month)
   - Buy credits (₹29 per try-on)
5. After payment → Credits added, can continue
```

### Premium User Journey
```
1. User subscribes to Premium (₹199/month)
2. Gets 25 try-ons immediately
3. Usage tracked throughout month
4. On 1st of next month → Resets to 25
5. Auto-renews monthly (can cancel anytime)
```

### Pay-Per-Use Journey
```
1. User out of credits → Opens paywall
2. Selects credit package (1, 5, or 10 credits)
3. Completes payment
4. Credits added instantly
5. Credits expire after 30 days
```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Usage Tracking

```typescript
// Check if user can make request
const { allowed, reason } = billingService.canMakeRequest();
if (!allowed) {
  throw new UsageLimitError(reason, ...);
}

// After successful API call
billingService.consumeTryOn('try-on');

// Get current stats
const stats = billingService.getUsageStats();
// {
//   used: 2,
//   remaining: 1,
//   limit: 3,
//   oneTimeCredits: 0,
//   percentUsed: 66.67,
//   tier: 'FREE',
//   daysUntilReset: 15
// }
```

### Payment Integration

```typescript
// Subscribe to Premium
razorpayService.subscribeTomonth(199, 
  (response) => {
    // Success: Upgrade user
    billingService.upgradeToPremium(response.razorpay_payment_id);
  },
  (error) => {
    // Handle error
  }
);

// Buy credits
razorpayService.buyCredits(5, 129,
  (response) => {
    // Success: Add credits
    billingService.addOneTimePurchase(5, 129, response.razorpay_payment_id);
  },
  (error) => {
    // Handle error
  }
);
```

### Data Persistence

All data stored in `localStorage`:

```javascript
// Billing data
vismyras_billing_user = {
  subscription: {...},
  usage: {...},
  oneTimePurchases: [...],
  transactions: [...]
}
```

**For Production**: Move to database with user authentication!

billing.usage.month = '2025-09'; // Set to past month
localStorage.setItem('vismyras_billing_user', JSON.stringify(billing));
location.reload();

// Should reset to 0 used, 3 limit ✅
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Current Limitations (Frontend-Only)

1. **No Backend Verification**
   - Payment verification happens in browser
   - Users could manipulate localStorage
   - **For Production**: Implement backend verification

2. **No User Authentication**
   - Data tied to browser, not account
   - Can't sync across devices
   - **For Production**: Add login/signup

3. **No Server-Side Validation**
   - Usage limits enforced client-side
   - Technically bypassable
   - **For Production**: Validate on server

### ✅ What's Secure

1. **Razorpay Integration**
   - Uses official Razorpay SDK
   - Payment processing is secure
   - PCI DSS compliant

2. **API Key Protection**
   - Key Secret never exposed to frontend
   - Only Key ID in browser
   - Proper environment variable usage

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevents API abuse
   - Multiple tiers (minute/hour/day)
   - Works with usage limits

## 📊 Business Metrics to Track

### Key Metrics

1. **Conversion Rate**
   - Free → Premium subscribers
   - Free → Pay-per-use buyers
   - Target: 5-10% conversion

2. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**
   - Monthly revenue / Active users
   - Target: ₹50-100 per user

3. **Churn Rate**
   - Premium subscribers canceling
   - Target: <5% monthly churn

4. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
   - Average subscription length × ₹199
   - Target: 6+ months = ₹1,194

### Analytics to Implement

```typescript
// Track these events:
- User hits free limit
- Paywall shown
- Subscription purchased
- Credits purchased
- Subscription cancelled
- Monthly renewal
- Payment failed
```
